# Teraisa's Neighborhood Map Project:
_by Teraisa J. Rogers_ with Udacity


With the help of Knockout JS, Google Maps API, Foursquare API, jQUERY, Bootstrap, Javascript, CSS, and HTML, we've compiled a list of five assorted true crimes along with their location.

### Before you begin (AKA Special Needs and Requirements)
1. [Clone or download pro5map](https://github.com/Teraisa/pro5map)

### What Now?
*Open `index.html` in your browser, the map will load automatically. Feel free to explore.
